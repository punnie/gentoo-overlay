h1. Punnie's Overlay

A small gentoo overlay containing some packages of interest.

h2. How to configure layman to manage this overlay

* Open @/etc/layman/layman.cfg@. 
* Find the line with @overlays :@ and add, in a new line, this URL: @http://github.com/punnie/gentoo-overlay/raw/master/profiles/overlay.xml@
* Run: @layman -a punnie@.
* ??????
* Profit!

h2. Small note about rvm ebuilds

When emerging @dev-ruby/rvm@, @FEATURES="-sandbox"@ should be passed on to portage, or else it will fail with a lot of "ACCESS DENIED" errors. 

I wouldn't recommend emerging multiple packages with this flag set this way, as it disables portage's sandbox which may cause failed merges to litter your system, possibly even breaking it.

h2. Thanks

To daltonmatos for creating the original overlay and giving me the idea, along with some nice ebuilds, along the way.
